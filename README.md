# ANPR-ATCC: Advanced Automatic Number Plate Recognition & Traffic Classification System

## Project Overview

ANPR-ATCC is a powerful, unified traffic monitoring platform combining:

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR):** Real-time detection and OCR extraction of vehicle license plates from images, videos, and camera streams.  
- **Automatic Traffic Classification (ATCC):** Multi-class vehicle detection supporting traffic density classification from live or recorded media.

This solution leverages the best of modern computer vision and OCR technologies, providing a **scalable, flexible, and easy-to-use** system ready for deployment in smart city projects, traffic analytics, law enforcement, and academic research.

***

## Key Features

- **Robust License Plate Detection & OCR**  
  Accurate YOLOv10 detection of diverse license plates combined with Tesseract OCR for high-fidelity text extraction.

- **Multi-class Vehicle Traffic Analyzer**  
  YOLOv11n-based vehicle detection classifies vehicle types, counts, and estimates traffic congestion in real-time.

- **Flexible Input Sources**  
  Supports video files, images, and real-time camera feeds (including experimental webcam streaming).

- **Comprehensive Data Logging & Visualization**  
  Outputs stored persistently in SQLite databases and cumulative JSON files with rich Streamlit dashboards showing historical analytics and detections.

- **Interactive and Customizable UI**  
  Streamlit interface features confidence and IoU threshold sliders, real-time detection previews, and database management tools.

- **Error Handling & Resilience**  
  Graceful fallback for OCR if Tesseract is unavailable, temporary file cleanup, and consistent database synchronization.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**  
  Tested on Linux, Windows, and macOS environments with detailed environment setup guides.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Separate processing pipelines for ANPR and ATCC enable extensibility and easy maintenance.

## Advanced Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+  
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed and added to system PATH  
- Conda environment recommended for dependency isolation

### Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nehakumari2003/ANPR-ATCC.git
cd ANPR-ATCC/ANPR-ATCC-Infosys


conda create -n cvproj python=3.11 -y
conda activate cvproj

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd yolov10
pip install -e .
cd ..


# Ensure SQLite databases are created automatically, else run:
python sqldb.py
```

### Optional: GPU Acceleration

If CUDA-enabled GPU is available, install torch and ultralytics versions compatible with your CUDA version to accelerate YOLO models.

### Environment Variables

- `TESSDATA_PREFIX` (optional): Path to Tesseract language data files if custom installed.

### Debugging Common Issues

- Fix numpy version conflicts:  
  ```bash
  pip uninstall numpy
  pip install numpy==1.26.4
  ```
- Confirm tesseract CLI works via terminal by running:  
  `tesseract --version`
- Check camera permissions on your OS before using webcam inputs.

## Detailed Usage

### License Plate Detector (LP)

- Upload video/image or use webcam to detect vehicle plates in real-time.  
- OCR extracted plate text displayed, saved to SQLite DB and JSON snapshots every 20 seconds.  
- Visual overlays help easily identify bounding boxes and recognized characters.

### Automatic Traffic Classifier & Counter (ATCC)

- Upload image/video or camera capture to detect various vehicle classes (cars, trucks, bikes).  
- View detailed analytics including vehicle counts, traffic levels (No/Low/Medium/High), and historic data logs.  
- Adjust confidence and IOU thresholds dynamically to tune detection sensitivity.

### Database Insights & Maintenance

- View raw analysis tables with full timestamped historic records in-app.  
- Clear or reset databases with UI buttons.  
- Export DB files for offline analysis or import into third-party tools.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Fork and clone the repo.  
- Create a new feature or bugfix branch.  
- Follow Python style conventions (PEP8) and write descriptive commit messages.  
- Test your changes thoroughly with provided notebooks and media.  
- Document any new APIs, workflows, or configurations in README or docstrings.  
- Submit a pull request referencing related issues or features.

***

## Testing & Validation

- Example media files and Jupyter notebooks are provided under `notebook/` for functional validation.  
- Unit tests for database operations and core detection pipelines to be added.  
- Continuous integration support planned (GitHub Actions) for automatic test runs on pull requests.

***

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- All data stored locally‚Äîno external servers involved, keeping sensitive information secure by design.  
- For production deployments, consider encrypting SQLite DB files and securing access paths.  
- Webcam and file uploads handled within browser sandbox, with no persistent external uploads.  
- Future versions may integrate authentication layers to enable controlled multi-user access.

## Future Work & Roadmap

- **Multi-language OCR support:** Increase scope beyond English license plates with PaddleOCR and custom models.  
- **Integration with Vehicle Registration APIs:** Cross-check extracted plates with official databases for real-time alerts.  
- **Edge Device Deployment:** Lightweight models optimized for Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, or embedded cameras.  
- **Cloud Sync & Visualization:** Remote data dashboard on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).  
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Dark mode, user profiles, notifications, and mobile responsiveness.  
- **Expanded Vehicle Classification:** Include electric scooters, buses, emergency vehicles, and non-motorized entities.  
- **AI Model Improvements:** Experiment with Transformer-based detectors for superior accuracy.
